# Adaptive Pinning Control using Network Controlability Gramian This project implements adaptive pinning control on a network of dynamic agents. Energy efficient pins are automatically selected using the Network Controlability Gramian.We consider the network as a Graph, $G=${ $V$, $E$ } such that:- **Vertices** ( $V$ ) are the agents (nodes)- **Edges** ( $E$ ) are a set of links in the form of ordered pairs - Edges are defined by the Cartesian Product $V \times V$, $E=$ {( $a$ , $b$ ) such that $a \in V$ and $b \in V$}- $G$ is simple, or ( $a$ , $a$) $\notin E~\forall~a \in V$  - $G$ is undirected, or ( $a$ , $b$ ) $\in E <=>$ ( $b$ , $a$) $\in E$- Nodes $i$ and $j$ are **neighbours** if they share an edge- **Adjacency** matrix $A=$ { $a_{ij}$ } with dimensions $N \times N$ describes the connections between nodes where $a_{ij}$ is $1$ if $i$ and $j$ are neighbours or $0$ otherwise- **Component** set of the graph is a set with no neighbours outside itselfWe define a **pin** for each component such that it consumes the minimal amount of energy to control its respective component. Here, we achieve this by computing the Network Controlability Gramian:$W_j=$ $\sum\limits_{h=0}^{H-1}$ $A_d^hb_jb_j^T\left(A_d^T\right)^h$where:- $A_d = AD^{-1}$- $D$ is the diagonal **augmented in-degree matrix** of $A$, composed by the sum of the columns of $A$ on its diagonal (or a $1$ when this sum is $0$)- $b_j$ is a column vector with all terms equal to $0$ except at the pin location $j$- $H$ is the control horizonThe **trace** of $W_j$ is inversely proportional to the average energy required to control the graph component when $j$ is selected as the pin. Therefore, we compute trace of $\left(W_j\right)$ for each candidate pin and select the one with the lowest value, thereby minimizing the control energy.The graph is built using **Olfati-Saber flocking** (Reference 4, below) such that the agents are considered to be *connected* when they are within radius $r$ of eachother. These connections are what define the components of the graph. The pins share a common target, which draws the separate components together. As the components meet, they combine to form a larger component. New pins are computed in **real-time**, until all agents form part of a single component representing the entire graph. This convergence is guaranteed, so long as the components are internally stable and share the same target.# PlotsBelow is are plots with adaptive pins, selected to conserve energy using the Network Controlability Gramian:<p float="center">    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/animation_pin_10.gif" width="45%" />    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/convergence_pin_10.png" width="45%" />    </p><p float="center">    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/animation_pin_9.gif" width="45%" />    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/convergence_pin_9.png" width="45%" />    </p># References 1.
