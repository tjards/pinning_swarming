# Exploration of Pinning ControlThis project implements pinning control.Goal: offensive. decide on which pins to destroy iot break the graph down.# PlotsBelow is a plot with three randomly-selected pins and a moving target:<p float="center">    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/animation_pin_5.gif" width="45%" />    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/convergence_pin_5.png" width="45%" />    </p>Below is a plot with adaptive pins, which are computed based on the number of connected components in the graph. The pins are in red. Notice they reduce as the agents converge:<p float="center">    <img src="https://github.com/tjards/pinning_swarming/blob/master/Figs/animation_pin_8.gif" width="70%" />    </p># CitingThe code is opensource but, if you reference this work in your own reserach, please cite me.
